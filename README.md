With ontainer-based and free limited resources in your private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb" target="_blank">PersonaDB</a>, you can start from this book image to create a new standard epub-3 book / document of your own contents. The service embraces required tools and processes of writing, reading, editing, publishing and social-networking the book provided by https://pub.khaiphong.io

The playing fields of <b>authoring and publishing</b> have been widely open for all players in all walks of life. Since each legal entity has its own private <b>Executive Information Portal (EIP)</b>, it is an excellent template and service for all corporate policies and documents to be privately and securely stored in the cloud where authorized users in appropriate Linux kernel namespaces and cgroups can access.

The service rides on standard "<b>Digital Right Management (DRM)</b>" where the author decides and manages the book copyright and license online together with the <b>book topic</b> such as #KhaiPhong, #HappyFamily, #HappyCouple, #BlankMind, #PrajmaTIP, etc, for social networking and movement generation. 

We make this happened with standard epub-3 layout of "<b>Verifiable Emptiness</b>" that you can (1) directly contribute with your reflection and investigation to weed out <b>criminals and professional scam artists from all isms</b> bullying humanity based on "<b>Fear and Greed</b>", (2) contrast your experience against Gotama personal experience enabling his personal opinions into statistically epistemic objectives, (3) use the book-image to create your own diary and/or epub-3 documents in your private repositories.
